- [Tweets job](.github/workflows/fetch-data.yml#12)

#### GitHub Action

#### How do we do it?

We use [Twitter's API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/introduction) to get the latest tweets that contain the word `nimiq`.

Then, we filter the tweets using [finiteautomata/bertweet-base-sentiment-analysis](https://huggingface.co/finiteautomata/bertweet-base-sentiment-analysis) model from Hugging Face ðŸ¤—.

#### Output

We store two tweets datasets: [All tweets](./output/tweets/tweets.json) and [Positive tweets](./output/tweets/positive-tweets.json).

#### How do we do it?

We use [GitHub's statistics API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/metrics/statistics) to get the stats of the last year, and then we filter the data to get the stats of the last `N_WEEKS`.

#### Output

We store two files: [Stats](./output/stats/stats.json) and [Stats by repo](./output/stats/stats-by-repo.json).
